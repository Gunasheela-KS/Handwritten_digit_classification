# Handwritten_digit_classification
The images containing handwritten digits are classified using neural network architecture in Keras module. 
Initially a simple neural network is designed to predict the different output classes.
Eventually hidden layers are added to improve the prediction accuracy. 
Different activation functions are explored to analyze the effect on prediction accuracy.
Python modules: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, keras.
Concepts explored: Neural networks, activation functions
